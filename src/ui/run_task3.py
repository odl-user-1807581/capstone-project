I need you to build a calculator app. The calculator should:
1. Have a clean, user-friendly interface

4. Display the current calculation and result clearly
5. Handle decimal numbers
6. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
7. Be responsive and work on different screen sizes

Please create a complete working calculator web application.
